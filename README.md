#Modern Blue-Themed Image Gallery (Flexbox Design)

A responsive image gallery designed entirely with HTML and CSS (Flexbox), featuring a clean modern blue theme. The layout is built from scratch using the Flexbox concept to ensure perfect alignment, spacing, and adaptability across all screen sizes.

The gallery design and interactivity concept are inspired by reference learning material (GreatStack), and I’m currently implementing the JavaScript functionality for the image pop-up and close (X) button actions.
